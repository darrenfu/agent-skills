# Debrief Report

An editorial, magazine-style format for presenting a structured work digest — what someone accomplished over a period. Bullet-point TLDR, project cards with What/Why/How summaries and highlight bundles, clean and scannable.

---

## When to Use

Detect this archetype when:
- User mentions "debrief", "work digest", "work recap", "weekly update", or "performance review"
- Content is a structured digest with projects, highlight cards, artifacts (diffs, tasks, posts, docs), and coverage data
- The input file is a `digest.md` with sections: Meta, Summary, Projects (each with What/Why/How + Highlights + collapsed Artifacts), Diffs Reviewed, Coverage
- User asks to "visualize a digest", "create a report from digest", or "generate a debrief report"
- Content describes one person's work over a time period with categorized artifacts

---

## Communication Goal

A debrief report communicates the breadth and impact of someone's work over a time period. The reader (the person themselves, their manager, or a peer) should understand in 10 seconds what the top projects were and what was achieved. In 30 seconds, they should grasp the full scope. The report is optimized for sharing — polished enough to post in a Slack group or include in a performance review packet, but not so corporate that it loses the texture of real engineering work.

**Critical design principle: This is a narrative report, NOT an artifact list.** Individual diffs and tasks are raw material — the report synthesizes them into themed highlights that tell a story about what was accomplished and why it matters.

---

## Layout DNA

The page opens with an **editorial header** — the person's name, period, and a clean dateline. No gradient banners or hero images; this is a magazine article, not a slide deck.

Immediately below, a **TLDR block** with bullet points — one bullet per major project/workstream, each with the project name bolded and a one-sentence impact statement. This is the "if you read nothing else" section. Styled with a subtle accent-colored left border and light tinted background.

A **stats ribbon** runs below the TLDR: compact inline counters for total diffs landed, diffs reviewed, tasks, posts, docs, thanks. Small, secondary, but present for completeness.

The **body** is a series of **always-visible project cards** — NOT collapsed. Each card has:
- A **prominent title** (serif, large) with an artifact count badge
- A **What/Why/How summary block** — three compact lines in a subtly styled container (muted background or left-border accent). What = outcome achieved, Why = business impact, How = technical approach. This gives the reader immediate context without reading highlights.
- **Exactly 3 highlight cards** — each with a bold title and 2-3 sentence narrative summarizing a bundle of related work (not an individual diff). Uses category tags like `[Shipped]`, `[Impact]`, `[Community]`, `[Planning]`, `[Infra]` as small colored pills. Highlights reference specific diffs/docs parenthetically `(D12345, D12346)` but the text is the story.
- A **collapsed "Artifacts (N diffs, N tasks, ...)"** section at the bottom with the raw diff/task/post/doc links for evidence

After all projects, a **"Slack Activity" section** — a cross-cutting view of where the subject is most engaged. Shows a **Top Themes table** (theme, post count, comment count, key groups), **Notable Posts** (3-5 most impactful posts with 1-sentence summaries), an **Active Discussions** narrative (1-2 sentences), and collapsed full lists of all posts and comments. This section reveals what's top-of-mind beyond code work.

Below that, a **compact "Diffs Reviewed" section** — thematic summaries by domain (not individual listings) with a collapsed full list. Shows collaboration breadth without dominating the page.

At the bottom, a **small coverage table** showing data sources, tools used, and result counts. Footer-tier element.

**Visual density:** Medium. Generous whitespace between cards, comfortable padding within them, but dense highlight bullets within each card.

**Max width:** 900px centered column. Editorial content.

---

## Interaction DNA

The page is primarily a reading experience:

- **Project cards are always visible.** No collapsing. The reader sees the full scope immediately — title + What/Why/How + 3 highlight cards for every project without clicking anything.
- **"Artifacts" is collapsed** (`<details>/<summary>`) within each card for those who want the raw list. Most readers won't open this.
- **"Slack Activity" shows engagement themes** — Top Themes table and Notable Posts always visible, full post/comment lists collapsed.
- **"Diffs Reviewed" shows thematic summaries** — domain-grouped summaries always visible, full list collapsed.
- **Hover on cards** — subtle shadow deepening. Not dramatic.
- **Links open in new tabs** — every artifact link has `target="_blank"`.
- **Category tags** are colored pills (Shipped=blue, Impact=green, Community=pink, Planning=amber, Infra=purple). Muted — these are labels, not alerts.
- **No charts, sparklines, or animations beyond entrance.** Text-forward.

Reading flow: header → TLDR bullets (10 seconds) → scan card titles → read highlights of interest → workplace activity themes → optionally expand raw artifact lists.

---

## Flavor Seeds

**Long-form Journalism** — A well-designed feature article in The Atlantic or Aeon: generous serif headings, comfortable body text, themed sections that each tell a story. White background with warm undertones, occasional color accents. The content breathes.

**Annual Report** — A nonprofit's annual impact report: clean, dignified, organized around themes rather than chronology. Each section tells a story about a body of work. Statistics are present but subordinate to narrative. The design says "this work mattered."

**Research Lab Notebook** — A well-kept lab journal, digitized: neat section headings, themed entries, cross-references between related items. Monospace accents for identifiers, a systematic color scheme for entry types. The satisfying organization of real intellectual work catalogued properly.

**Architecture Portfolio** — A portfolio website: one project per section, each with a concise description and key highlights. Clean grid, restrained palette. The work speaks for itself. The layout communicates professionalism and attention to craft.

**Curated Exhibition Catalog** — A museum catalog for a themed exhibition: each body of work gets thematic grouping with a curator's narrative. The design is spare and respectful, with typography doing the heavy lifting.

## CDN Dependencies

None required. Purely structural and typographic. No charts, no D3, no external JS.

## Recommended Components

| Component | How to Use |
|-----------|-----------|
| **TLDR Block** | Accent-bordered box with bullet points. One bullet per major project — bolded name + impact sentence. |
| **Stats Ribbon** | Horizontal inline stat counters: "51 diffs · 10 reviewed · 1 task · 5 posts · 13 docs · 8 thanks". Small, centered. |
| **Project Card** | Always-visible card with: serif title + count badge, What/Why/How summary block, 3 highlight cards, collapsed artifact list. |
| **What/Why/How Block** | Compact 3-line block inside each project card. Subtle styling (muted background or left-border accent). Each line labeled **What**/**Why**/**How** in bold. |
| **Highlight Card** | Bold title + 2-3 sentence narrative bundle. Category tag pill. References artifact IDs parenthetically. Exactly 3 per project. |
| **Category Tag** | Small colored pill on each highlight card: Shipped (blue), Impact (green), Community (pink), Planning (amber), Infra (purple). |
| **Collapsed Artifact List** | `<details>/<summary>` at bottom of each project card: "Artifacts (N diffs, N tasks, ...)" → raw diff/task list with IDs and links. |
| **Slack Activity Section** | Top Themes table (theme, posts, comments, groups), Notable Posts (3-5 with summaries), Active Discussions narrative, collapsed full lists. |
| **Reviewed Section** | Thematic summaries by domain always visible + collapsed full list. Secondary. |
| **Coverage Table** | Small footer table. Columns: Source, Tool, Count, Coverage. Minimal styling. |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| List individual diffs as the primary content | The report should tell a STORY, not be a changelog. Synthesize diffs into themed highlights. |
| Use collapsible/accordion for workstream sections | Workstreams should be immediately visible. Collapsed sections hide the work and require clicks to understand scope. |
| Use a gradient hero banner or dark header | Editorial report, not a slide deck. The content IS the hero. |
| Use charts or sparklines for artifact counts | Numbers are too small for charts. "23 diffs" as text is more honest than a bar chart. |
| Color-code metrics (red/green) | No "good" or "bad" in a work recap. Avoid value judgments on artifact counts. |
| Use a dashboard grid layout | Reading document, not a monitoring screen. Single-column editorial. |
| Make the coverage table prominent | Methodology metadata, not content. Small, at the bottom. |
| Use heavy card borders or shadows | Editorial tone = subtle dividers and whitespace, not Material Design elevation. |
| Put Diffs Reviewed in the same visual tier as workstreams | Reviews are secondary. Compact counter + expandable list. |
| Skip the TLDR | The bullet-point summary is the most important element. If someone reads 5 bullets and leaves, they got the full picture. |

## Coverage
| Source | Tool | Results Found | Coverage Level |
...

<!-- DIGEST_COMPLETE -->
```

**Mapping digest → report:**
- `## Summary` → TLDR bullet points (synthesize into one bullet per project, not raw summary text)
- `## Projects` → Project cards (each with What/Why/How block, 3 highlight cards, collapsed artifacts)
- `## Slack Activity` → Top Themes table, Notable Posts, Active Discussions narrative, collapsed full lists
- `## Diffs Reviewed` → Thematic summaries + collapsed full list
- `## Coverage` → Footer table

**Key principle:** The digest already contains synthesized highlights and What/Why/How summaries. The report renders them visually — it does NOT need to re-synthesize. Map the digest structure directly to the visual components.

## Variations

- **Self-debrief** (default): Narrative tone focused on impact and achievements
- **Manager view / roll-up**: Multiple people's digests combined, comparison across team members
- **performance review packet insert**: More formal, achievement-focused, metrics emphasized
- **Weekly update post**: Shorter, conversational, designed for Slack sharing
- **Project-scoped debrief**: Single project across a longer period, deeper narrative per workstream
